A simple file writer asynchronous task for android, writes to internal storage.

Usage:
	static AsyncTask<LinkedBlockingQueue<String[]>, Void, Void> fw;
	static LinkedBlockingQueue<String[]> writelist;
	writelist = new LinkedBlockingQueue<String[]>();
	fw = new FileWriter().execute(writelist);

	Then pass the instance of writelist to any class or thread that needs to be
able to write to a file.

	To write to a file:

	String[] params = new String[items+3]; // items = number of lines
	params[0] = "file name.ext";
	params[1] = "n"; // "a" to append instead of overwrite
	params[2] = "n"; // "" to not put a new line in every param_i after this
	/*
		It prints each item after this as a "line". If you have params[2] = "n",
		then it will place '\n' after each "line".
	*/
  params[3...] = "some line"
	writelist.put(params);

Tested on 2.2 and 2.3.
